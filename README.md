# Kattis
Problems I have solved, and cool things I have learned on open.kattis.com 

I will try to always push solutions/snippets with detailed comments. This repo is for learning purposes. Feel free to use my solutions, 
change them, steal them and rip them off as your own, whatever you like... as long as you learn from them!

## Conventions:
All kattis solutions are named by their problem id on kattis and are enclosed in a directory by that name. If they have sample inputs
or expected outputs those will be included in the directory. All files that are not enclosed in a directory are some kind of code
snippet which I find helpful or interesting.

NOTE: Ratings listed in solutions are tentative. They constantly change and update as new submissions are made.
