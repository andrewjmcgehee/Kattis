# Kattis
Problems I have solved on open.kattis.com 

I will try to always push them with detailed comments. 
This repo is for learning purposes. Feel free to use my solutions, change them, steal them and rip them off as your own,
whatever you like... as long as you learn from them!

NOTE: Ratings listed in code are tentative. They constantly change and update as
new submissions are made.
